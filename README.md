# Experimental Operating System
ExperimentalOS is built upon the XSM architecture. Architecture includes the specifications for the
machine organisation, paging and interrupt handling and also provides the machine level instruction
set.
Functionalities Implemented
1.Process Management: Scheduling and dispatching processes to the CPU with additional support for
multi-programming using semaphores.
2.Memory Management: Allocating memory for processes with support for demand paging.
3.User Management: Implementation of multi-user system calls.
